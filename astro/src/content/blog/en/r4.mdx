### Timeline
With auto timestamping now 100% more robust you get increasingly sequential content as a beautiful timeline. The newest includes shortly thereafter, helping to provide needed context and perspective.

### Images & Files Drawer
Large images on the page often provide important context. They are now automatically detected and included with a summary, so you can access them later.

The drawer is divided into two sections: active context and available context pull out only charts, images etc. You active context is what the AI engine uses to have the "full picture" and the available context provides access if you want. We can add any combination of files, images, page screenshots, or text selections to the active context, which the AI engine will use to semantically register or activate outcomes.

### Notes & Highlights
Now you can highlight areas of interest and leave voice memos. Notes are semantic search-able as well:

## FAQ

### Is it FREE?

- Pointls is a Freemium product, with most features available for free within a daily limit.

- Monthly subscription raises interaction credits to 100/day and unlocks storing more than 50 items. Experimental "Boost mode" uses 3x credits.

### Can I use it on my Phone?

- Yes for Android phones (Samsung, Google, etc). You need to install [Kiwi browser](https://kiwibrowser.com/) with plugins support. Works best on foldable and tablet devices.

- Apple and Google intentionally limit third-party in-browser experiences. We're looking into creative solutions to provide better support.
